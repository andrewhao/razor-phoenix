# AppPrototype

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`


# Requirements
  * phantomjs is required for acceptance testing with Wallaby, i.e. `yarn global add phantomjs`
    See more at the [`wallaby`](https://github.com/keathley/wallaby)

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
In Chrome, you may instead have to visit [`127.0.0.1:4000`](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

## Notes
  * You will see warnings from several dependencies the first time they're compiled.
    This is because many of them have not yet been upgraded for elixir 1.4, and they can be ignored.
